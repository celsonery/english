# Kenny Loggins - Footloose

| English | PortuguÃªs BR |
|------:|:--------------------|
| I've been working so hard |
| I'm punching my card |
| 8 hours for what? |
| Oh, tell me what i got |
| I've got this feeling |
| That time's just holding me down |
| I'll hit the ceiling or else i'll tear up this town |
|  |
| Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose |
| Kick off your Sunday shoes |
| Please, Louise, pull me off a my knees |
| Jack, get back |
| C'mon before we crack |
| Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose |
|  |
| And you're playing so cool |
| Obeying every rule |
| I dig a way down in your heart |
| You're burning, yearning for songs |
| Somebody to tell you |
| That life ain't passing you by |
| I'm trying to tell you |
| It will if you don't even try |
|  |
| You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose |
| Kick off your Sunday shoes |
| Oowhee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me |
| Whoa, Milo, c'mon, c'mon let's go |
| Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose |
|  |
| Cut footloose |
| Cut footloose |
| Cut footloose |
|  |
| We got to turn me around |
| And put your feet on the ground |
| Now take a hold of the phone |
| Whoa |
|  |
| I'm turning it loose, footloose |
| Kick off your Sunday shoes |
| Please, Louise, pull me off a my knees |
| Jack, get back |
| C'mon before we crack |
| Lose your blues, now everybody cut footloose |
|  |
| Loose, footloose |
| Kick off your Sunday shoes |
| Please, Louise, pull me off a my knees |
| Jack, get back |
| C'mon before we crack |
| Lose your blues |
|  |
| Everybody cut, everybody cut |
| Everybody cut, everybody cut |
| Everybody cut, everybody cut |
| Everybody, everybody cut footloose |
