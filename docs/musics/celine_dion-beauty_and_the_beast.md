# Céline Dion - Beauty And The Beast

| English | Português BR |
|------:|:--------------------|
| Tale as old as time |
| True as it can be |
| Barely even friends |
| That somebody bends |
| Unexpectedly |
|  |
| Just a little change |
| Small, to say the least |
| Both a little scared |
| Neither one prepared |
| Beauty and the Beast |
|  |
| Ever just the same |
| Ever a surprise |
| Ever as before |
| Never just that sure |
| As the sun will rise |
|  |
| Ever just the same |
| Ever a surprise |
| Ever as before |
| Ever just that sure |
| As the sun will rise |
|  |
| Tale as old as time |
| Tune as old as song |
| Bittersweet and strange |
| Finding you can change |
| Learning you were wrong |
|  |
| Certain as the sun |
| Rising in the east |
| Tale as old as time |
| Song as old as rhyme |
| Beauty and the beast |
|  |
| Tale as old as time |
| Song as old as rhyme |
| Beauty and the Beast |
