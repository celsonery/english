|------:|:--------------------|
| Here comes Johnny singing Oldies, Goldies |
| Be-bop-a-lula, baby, what I say |
| Here comes Johnny singing I gotta woman |
| Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay |
|  |
| He got the action, he got the motion |
| Oh yeah, the boy can play |
| Dedication, devotion |
| Turning all the night time into the day |
|  |
| He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman |
| He do the song about the knife |
| And he do the walk, he do the walk of life |
| Yeah, he do the walk of life |
|  |
| Here comes Johnny goin' tell you the story |
| Hand me down my walkin' shoes |
| Here come Johnny with the power and the glory |
| Backbeat, the talkin' blues |
|  |
| He got the action, he got the motion |
| Yeah, the boy can play |
| Dedication, devotion |
| Turning all the night time into the day |
|  |
| He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman |
| He do the song about the knife |
| And he do the walk, he do the walk of life |
| Yeah, he do the walk of life |
|  |
| Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies |
| Be-bop-a-lula, baby what I say |
| Here comes Johnny singing "I Gotta Woman" |
| Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay |
|  |
| He got the action, he got the motion |
| Oh yeah, the boy can play |
| Dedication, devotion |
| Turning all the night time into the day |
| And after all the violence and double talk |
| There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife |
| You do the walk, you do the walk of life |
| Hum, you do the walk of life |
