# Adele - Hello

| English | Português BR |
|------:|:--------------------|
| Hello, it's me | Olá sou eu
| I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet | Eu fui ... se depois de todos esses anos você gostaria de se encontrar
| To go over everything | 
| They say that time's supposed to heal ya |
| But I ain't done much healing |
||
| Hello, can you hear me? | Olá, você pode me ouvir?
| I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be |
| When we were younger and free |
| I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet |
| There's such a difference between us |
| And a million miles |
|  |
| Hello from the other side |
| I must've called a thousand times |
| To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done |
| But when I call, you never seem to be home |
| Hello from the outside |
| At least I can say that I've tried |
| To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart |
| But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore |
|  |
| Hello, how are you? |
| It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry |
| I hope that you're well |
| Did you ever make it out of that town |
| Where nothing ever happened? |
| It's no secret that the both of us |
| Are running out of time |
|  |
| So hello from the other side (other side) |
| I must've called a thousand times (thousand times) |
| To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done |
| But when I call, you never seem to be home |
| Hello from the outside (outside) |
| At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) |
| To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart |
| But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore |

| (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) |
| Ooh, anymore |
| (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) |
| Ooh, anymore |
