# Roxette - Spending My Time

| English | PortuguÃªs BR |
|------:|:--------------------|
| What's the time? |
| Seems it's already morning |
| I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue |
| The TV's on, but the only thing showing is a picture of you |
|  |
| Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee |
| I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin |
| I thank the Lord above |
| You're not here to see me in this shape I'm in |
|  |
| Spending my time |
| Watching the days go by |
| Feeling so small, I stare at the wall |
| Hoping that you think of me too |
| I'm spending my time |
|  |
| I try to call, but I don't know what to tell you |
| I leave a kiss on your answering machine |
| Oh, help me please |
| Is there someone who can make me |
| Wake up from this dream? |
|  |
| Spending my time |
| Watching the days go by |
| Feeling so small, I stare at the wall |
| Hoping that you are missing me too |
|  |
| I'm spending my time (spending my time) |
| Watching the Sun go down |
| I fall sleep to the sound |
| Of Tears of a Clown |
| A prayer gone blind |
| I'm spending my time |
|  |
| My friends keep telling me: Hey, life will go on |
| Time will make sure I'll get over you |
| This silly game of love |
| You play, you win only to lose |
|  |
| I'm spending my time (spending my time) |
| Watching the days go by |
| Feeling so small, I stare at the wall |
| Hoping that you think of me too |
|  |
| I'm spending my time (spending my time) |
| Watching the Sun go down |
| I fall sleep to the sound |
| Tears of a Clown |
| A prayer gone blind |
| I'm spending my time |
|  |
| (Spending my time) |
| I can't live without your love |
| (Spending my time) |
| I'm spending my time, my time, my time |
| This bed's too big without you, honey, honey |
| (Spending my time) |
