# Simple Minds - Don't You (forget About Me)

| English | PortuguÃªs BR |
|------:|:--------------------|
| (Hey, hey, hey, hey) |
|  |
| Won't you come see about me |
| I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby |
| Tell me your troubles and doubts |
| Giving me everything inside and out |
| And love's strange: so real in the dark |
| Think of the tender things |
| That we were working on |
| Slow change may pull us apart |
| When the light gets in your heart, baby |
|  |
| Don't you forget about me |
| Don't, don't, don't, don't |
| Don't you forget about me |
|  |
| Will you stand above me |
| Look my way, never love me |
| Rain keeps falling |
| Rain keeps falling |
| Down, down, down |
| Will you recognize me |
| Call my name or walk on by |
| Rain keeps falling |
| Rain keeps falling |
| Down, down, down, down |
|  |
| (Hey, hey, hey, hey) |
|  |
| Don't you try and pretend |
| It's my beginning |
| We'll win in the end |
| I won't harm you |
| Or touch your defenses |
| Vanity, insecurity |
|  |
| Don't you forget about me |
| I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby |
| Going to take you apart |
| I'll build us back together at heart, baby |
|  |
| Don't you forget about me |
| Don't, don't, don't, don't |
| Don't you forget about me |
|  |
| As you walk on by |
| Will you call my name |
| As you walk on by |
| Will you call my name |
| When you walk away |
|  |
| Oh, will you walk away |
| Will you walk away |
| Oh, call my name |
| Will you call my name |
