# Men At Work - Overkill

| English | PortuguÃªs BR |
|------:|:--------------------|
| I cant get to sleep |
| I think about the implications |
| Of diving in too deep |
| And possibly the complications |
|  |
| Specially at night |
| I worry over situations |
| I know it'll be alright |
| Perhaps it's just imagination |
|  |
| Day after day it reappears |
| Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear |
| Ghosts appear and fade away |
|  |
| Alone between the sheets |
| Only brings exasperation |
| It's time to walk the streets |
| Smell the desperation |
|  |
| But at least there are pretty lights |
| And though there's little variation |
| It nullifies the night |
| From overkill |
|  |
| Day after day it reappears |
| Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear |
| Ghosts appear and fade away |
| Come back another day |
|  |
| I cant get to sleep |
| I think about the implications |
| Of diving in too deep |
| And possibly the complications |
|  |
| Specially at night |
| I worry over situations |
| I know it'll be alright |
| It's just overkill |
|  |
| Day after day it reappears |
| Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear |
| Ghosts appear and fade away |
