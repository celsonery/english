|------:|:--------------------|
| Now here I am again in this mean old town |
| And you're so far away from me |
| Now where are you when the sun goes down? |
| You're so far away from me |
|  |
| You're so far away from me |
| So far I just can't see |
| You're so far away from me |
| You're so far away from me |
| Alright |
|  |
| I'm tired of being in love and being all alone |
| When you're so far away from me |
| I'm tired of making out on the telephone |
| 'Cause you're so far away from me |
|  |
| You're so far away from me |
| So far I just can't see |
| You're so far away from me |
| You're so far away from me |
| Alright |
|  |
| And I get so tired when I have to explain |
| That you're so far away from me |
| See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain |
| And you're so far away from me |
|  |
| You're so far away from me |
| So far I just can't see |
| You're so far away from me |
